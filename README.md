A brief description of your project
My project is based on the six essetial oils that can heal and change your life.  I use all of these oils and they can basically boost your immune system, heal burns, wounds, etc.  This is a passion of mine to help replace the meds I am taking and people around are taking. This is supposed to a blog page that would come up if someone is looking for alternate ways to heal the mind, body and spirit.



The class(es) I created are:

I had everything in Bootstrap and scratched it at a late date and reworked everything.  So with Chris's help in Tuesday we changed CSS to id's.  I had flex containers and again we changed it on Tuesday to make it responsive easier than I had it structured.  So in my CSS Main Content is the six oils that heal and we styled all of those together.   Id's for Topnav and Main and for the syling of the images inside. We also included media queries to make the site to work when on smaller devices.  I struggled with the responsive design and felt like I had that down so then I thought I would use bootstrap and then scrapped it in the last few hours of class. 


 JavaScript I wanted a submit button and went to different sites and then ended up liking this one the best, easy and submit.  I love JavaScript but definitely need more practice with it. Used jquery to make the submit form work.
